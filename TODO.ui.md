# SeNARS UI2 Refactoring Roadmap

**Vision**: Refactor `ui/` to enable **versatile UI creation** and **minimal boilerplate** through metaprogramming, while preserving and enhancing existing functionality.

**Approach**: Build **alongside** existing UI - no breaking changes. Focus on **tangible wins**, avoid overengineering.

---

## Phase 1: Metaprogramming Foundations ✅ **COMPLETE**

Create core utilities to reduce boilerplate by ~80%.

### Completed

- ✅ **ReactiveState** - Proxy-based reactive state with watchers & computed properties
- ✅ **ServiceContainer** - Dependency injection container  
- ✅ **EventBus** - Centralized events with wildcards & middleware
- ✅ **Decorators** - `@inject`, `@autobind`, `@debounce`, `@throttle`, `@memoize`, `@validate`
- ✅ **FluentUI** - Enhanced fluent DOM builder (consolidated with ComponentBuilder)
  - Added: `data()`, `childIf()`, `each()`, `apply()`, `destroy()`
  - Added shortcuts: `$()`, `div()`, `button()`, `input()`, etc.
  - Added helpers: `list()`, `table()`, `form()`
- ✅ **ComponentGenerator** - Template-based component factories
- ✅ **Examples & Documentation**

---

## Phase 2: Simple Custom Views

Create specialized UI views with minimal code - no overengineering.

### 2.1 Simple View Examples

Create practical examples showing how to build custom UIs:

- [ ] **Pure Agent REPL** (`agent-simple.html`)
  - Just the agent chat component
  - WebLLM connection
  - ~20 lines total
  
- [ ] **Metrics Dashboard** (`metrics-dashboard.html`)
  - System metrics panel + graph
  - Remote connection only
  - ~30 lines total

- [ ] **Minimal REPL** (`repl-minimal.html`)
  - Notebook only, no sidebars
  - Local or remote
  - ~15 lines total

**Approach**: Each view is its own simple HTML file that directly instantiates what it needs. No manifest parser, no complex builder system.

### 2.2 Component Extraction

Make it easy to compose custom views by extracting reusable pieces:

- [ ] Create simple component initialization helpers
  ```javascript
  // Simple helper, not a framework
  function createNotebookView(container, connection) {
    const panel = new NotebookPanel(container);
    panel.initialize({ connection });
    return panel;
  }
  ```

- [ ] Document common patterns in examples
- [ ] Keep it simple - just regular JS, no magic

---

## Phase 3: Enhanced Existing Components

Gradually enhance existing components using new utilities.

🎯 **Next Up** - Pick tangible wins from Phase 3-5

📝 **Experimental** - ZUI kept separate (Phase 6)

---

## Success Criteria

✅ **Reduced boilerplate** - 40% less code in refactored components

✅ **Better UX** - Message visibility, enhanced browsing, new widgets

✅ **Simple custom views** - Easy to create specialized UIs

✅ **Experimental ZUI** - Innovative graph-centric option available

✅ **Production ready** - Tests, docs, accessibility

✅ **Backward compatible** - Existing code works unchanged

---

## Skipped (Avoiding Overengineering)

- ❌ Complex UIBuilder/manifest system - too much abstraction
- ❌ State management framework - use browser storage directly
- ❌ URL encoding - not essential
- ❌ Plugin system - YAGNI (You Aren't Gonna Need It)
- ❌ Auto-save/persistence - manual save is fine
- ❌ Collaboration features - out of scope

**Keep it simple. Focus on tangible improvements.**
